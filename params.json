{"name":"T","body":"# Twitter CLI [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sferik/t.png?branch=master)][travis] [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/sferik/t.png?travis)][gemnasium] [![Click here to make a donation to T](http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/17330.png)][pledgie]\r\n### A command-line power tool for Twitter.\r\n\r\nThe CLI takes syntactic cues from the [Twitter SMS commands][sms], however it\r\noffers vastly more commands and capabilities than are available via SMS.\r\n\r\n[travis]: http://travis-ci.org/sferik/t\r\n[gemnasium]: https://gemnasium.com/sferik/t\r\n[pledgie]: http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/17330\r\n[gem]: https://rubygems.org/gems/twitter\r\n[sms]: https://support.twitter.com/articles/14020-twitter-sms-command\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n    # Requires Ruby :)\r\n    gem install t\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nTwitter requires OAuth for most of its functionality, so you'll need to\r\nregister a new application at <http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new>. Once you\r\ncreate your application, make sure to set your application's Access Level to\r\n\"Read, Write and Access direct messages\", otherwise you may receive an error\r\nthat looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    Read-only application cannot POST\r\n\r\nOnce you've successfully registered your application, you'll be given a\r\nconsumer key and secret, which you can use to authorize your Twitter account.\r\n\r\n    t authorize -c YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY -s YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET\r\n\r\nThis command directs you to a URL where you can sign-in to Twitter and then\r\nenter the returned PIN back into the terminal. If you type the PIN correctly,\r\nyou should now be authorized to use `t` as that user. To authorize multiple\r\naccounts, simply repeat the last step, signing into Twitter as a different\r\nuser.\r\n\r\nYou can see a list of all the accounts you've authorized by typing the command:\r\n\r\n    t accounts\r\n\r\nThe output of which will be structured like this:\r\n\r\n    sferik\r\n      UDfNTpOz5ZDG4a6w7dIWj\r\n      uuP7Xbl2mEfGMiDu1uIyFN\r\n    gem\r\n      thG9EfWoADtIr6NjbL9ON (active)\r\n\r\n**Note**: One of your authorized accounts (specifically, the last one\r\nauthorized) will be set as active. To change the active account, use the `set`\r\nsubcommand, passing either just a username, if it's unambiguous, or a username\r\nand consumer key pair, like this:\r\n\r\n    t set active sferik UDfNTpOz5ZDG4a6w7dIWj\r\n\r\nAccount information is stored in a YAML-formatted file located at `~/.trc`.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Anyone with access to this file can masquerade as you on Twitter, so\r\nit's important to keep it secure, just as you would treat your SSH private key.\r\nFor this reason, the file is hidden and has the permission bits set to `0600`.\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\nTyping `t help` will list all the available commands. You can type `t help\r\nTASK` to get help for a specific command.\r\n\r\n    t help\r\n\r\n### Update your status\r\n    t update \"I'm tweeting from the command line. Isn't that special?\"\r\n\r\n**Note**: If your tweet includes special characters (e.g. `!`), make sure to\r\nwrap it in single quotes instead of double quotes, so those characters are not\r\ninterpreted by your shell. (However, if you use single quotes, your Tweet\r\nobviously can't contain any apostrophes.)\r\n\r\n### Retrieve detailed information about a Twitter user\r\n    t whois @sferik\r\n\r\n### Retrieve stats for multiple users\r\n    t users -l @sferik @gem\r\n\r\n### Follow users\r\n    t follow @sferik @gem\r\n\r\n### Check whether one user follows another\r\n    t does_follow @ev @sferik\r\n\r\n**Note**: If the first user does not follow the second, `t` will exit with a\r\nnon-zero exit code. This allows you to execute commands conditionally, for\r\nexample, send a user a direct message only if he already follows you:\r\n\r\n    t does_follow @ev && t dm @ev \"What's up, bro?\"\r\n\r\n### Create a list for everyone you're following\r\n    t list create following-`date \"+%Y-%m-%d\"`\r\n\r\n### Add everyone you're following to that list (up to 500 users)\r\n    t followings | xargs t list add following-`date \"+%Y-%m-%d\"`\r\n\r\n### List all the members of a list, in long format\r\n    t list members -l following-`date \"+%Y-%m-%d\"`\r\n\r\n### List all your lists, in long format\r\n    t lists -l\r\n\r\n### List all your friends, in long format, ordered by number of followers\r\n    t friends -lf\r\n\r\n### List all your leaders (people you follow who don't follow you back)\r\n    t leaders -lf\r\n\r\n### Unfollow everyone you follow who doesn't follow you back\r\n    t leaders | xargs t unfollow\r\n\r\n### Twitter roulette: randomly follow someone who follows you (who you don't already follow)\r\n    t groupies | shuf | head -1 | xargs t follow\r\n\r\n### Favorite the last 10 tweets that mention you\r\n    t mentions -n 10 -l | awk '{print $1}' | xargs t favorite\r\n\r\n### Output the last 200 tweets in your timeline to a CSV file\r\n    t timeline -n 200 --csv > timeline.csv\r\n\r\n### Start streaming your timeline (Control-C to stop)\r\n    t stream timeline\r\n\r\n### Count the number of employees who work for Twitter\r\n    t list members twitter team | wc -l\r\n\r\n### Search Twitter for the 20 most recent Tweets that match a specified query\r\n    t search all \"query\"\r\n\r\n### Download the latest Linux kernel via BitTorrent (possibly NSFW, depending where you work)\r\n    t search all \"lang:en filter:links linux torrent\" -n 1 | grep -o \"http://t.co/[0-9A-Za-z]*\" | xargs open\r\n\r\n### Search Tweets you've favorited that match a specified query\r\n    t search favorites \"query\"\r\n\r\n### Search Tweets mentioning you that match a specified query\r\n    t search mentions \"query\"\r\n\r\n### Search Tweets you've retweeted that match a specified query\r\n    t search retweets \"query\"\r\n\r\n### Search Tweets in your timeline that match a specified query\r\n    t search timeline \"query\"\r\n\r\n### Search Tweets in another user's timeline that match a specified query\r\n    t search user @sferik \"query\"\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Deep search: Instead of using the Twitter Search API, [which only only goes\r\n  back 6-9 days][index], `t search` fetches up to 3,200 tweets via the REST API\r\n  and then checks each one against a regular expression.\r\n* Multithreaded: Whenever possible, Twitter API requests are made in parallel,\r\n  resulting in faster performance for bulk operations.\r\n* Designed for Unix: Output is designed to be piped to other Unix utilities,\r\n  like grep, cut, awk, bc, wc, and xargs for advanced text processing.\r\n* Generate spreadsheets: Convert the output of any command to CSV format simply\r\n  by adding the `--csv` flag.\r\n* 95% C0 Code Coverage: Well tested, with a 2.5:1 test-to-code ratio.\r\n\r\n[search]: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search\r\n\r\n# Using T for Backup\r\n\r\n[@jphpsf][jphpsf] wrote a [blog post][blog] explaining how to use `t` to backup\r\nyour Twitter account.\r\n\r\n[jphpsf]: https://github.com/jphpsf\r\n[blog]: http://blog.jphpsf.com/2012/05/07/backing-up-your-twitter-account-with-t/\r\n\r\n`t` was also mentioned on [an episode of the Ruby 5 podcast][ruby5].\r\n\r\n[ruby5]: http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/273-episode-269-may-4th-2012/stories/2400-t-command-line-power-tool-for-twitter\r\n\r\nIf you discuss `t` in a blog post or podcast, [let me know][email] and I'll\r\nlink it here.\r\n\r\n[email]: mailto:sferik@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## Relationship Terminology\r\n\r\nThere is some ambiguity in the terminology used to describe relationships on\r\nTwitter. For example, some people use the term \"friends\" to mean everyone you\r\nfollow. In `t`, \"friends\" refers to just the subset of people who follow you\r\nback (i.e., friendship is bidirectional). Here is the full table of terminology\r\nused by `t`:\r\n\r\n                               ___________________________________________________\r\n                              |                         |                         |\r\n                              |     YOU FOLLOW THEM     |  YOU DON'T FOLLOW THEM  |\r\n     _________________________|_________________________|_________________________|_________________________\r\n    |                         |                         |                         |                         |\r\n    |     THEY FOLLOW YOU     |         friends         |        groupies         |        followers        |\r\n    |_________________________|_________________________|_________________________|_________________________|\r\n    |                         |                         |\r\n    |  THEY DON'T FOLLOW YOU  |         leaders         |\r\n    |_________________________|_________________________|\r\n                              |                         |\r\n                              |       followings        |\r\n                              |_________________________|\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Timeline](https://github.com/sferik/t/raw/master/screenshots/timeline.png)\r\n![List](https://github.com/sferik/t/raw/master/screenshots/list.png)\r\n\r\n## History\r\nThe [twitter gem][gem] previously contained a command-line interface, up until\r\nversion 0.5.0, when it was [removed][]. This project is offered as a sucessor\r\nto that effort, however it is a clean room implementation that contains none of\r\nthe original code.\r\n\r\n[removed]: https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter/commit/dd2445e3e2c97f38b28a3f32ea902536b3897adf\r\n![History](https://github.com/sferik/t/raw/master/screenshots/history.png)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nIn the spirit of [free software][free-sw], **everyone** is encouraged to help\r\nimprove this project.\r\n\r\n[free-sw]: http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html\r\n\r\nHere are some ways *you* can contribute:\r\n\r\n* by using alpha, beta, and prerelease versions\r\n* by reporting bugs\r\n* by suggesting new features\r\n* by writing or editing documentation\r\n* by writing specifications\r\n* by writing code (**no patch is too small**: fix typos, add comments, clean up\r\n  inconsistent whitespace)\r\n* by refactoring code\r\n* by fixing [issues][]\r\n* by reviewing patches\r\n* [financially][pledgie]\r\n\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/sferik/t/issues\r\n\r\n## Submitting an Issue\r\nWe use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features. Before\r\nsubmitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't\r\nalready been submitted. When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist][]\r\nthat includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce\r\nthe bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system.\r\nIdeally, a bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.\r\n\r\n[gist]: https://gist.github.com/\r\n\r\n## Submitting a Pull Request\r\n1. [Fork the repository.][fork]\r\n2. [Create a topic branch.][branch]\r\n3. Add specs for your unimplemented feature or bug fix.\r\n4. Run `bundle exec rake spec`. If your specs pass, return to step 3.\r\n5. Implement your feature or bug fix.\r\n6. Run `bundle exec rake spec`. If your specs fail, return to step 5.\r\n7. Run `open coverage/index.html`. If your changes are not completely covered\r\n   by your tests, return to step 3.\r\n8. Add, commit, and push your changes.\r\n9. [Submit a pull request.][pr]\r\n\r\n[fork]: http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/\r\n[branch]: http://learn.github.com/p/branching.html\r\n[pr]: http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/\r\n\r\n## Supported Ruby Versions\r\nThis library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby\r\nimplementations:\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.8.7\r\n* Ruby 1.9.2\r\n* Ruby 1.9.3\r\n\r\nIf something doesn't work on one of these Ruby versions, it's a bug.\r\n\r\nThis library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby\r\nimplementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIf you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may\r\nvolunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests\r\nrun and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your\r\nimplementation, you will be responsible for providing patches in a timely\r\nfashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time\r\nof a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Erik Michaels-Ober.
